## Dataset Columns With Definitions
1. Neo Reference ID: A unique identifier assigned to each Near Earth Object (NEO) by the NeoWs API. This ID is used to reference and identify specific NEOs within the database.
2. Est Dia in M(min): The estimated minimum diameter of the NEO in meters.
3. Est Dia in M(max): The estimated maximum diameter of the NEO in meters.
4. Relative Velocity km per sec: The relative velocity of the NEO with respect to Earth, measured in kilometers per second. This parameter indicates the speed at which the NEO is approaching or receding from Earth.
5. Miss Dist.(kilometers): The closest miss distance of the NEO from Earth, measured in kilometers.
6. Perihelion Distance: The perihelion distance of the NEO's orbit, representing the closest distance between the NEO and the Sun.
7. Aphelion Dist: The aphelion distance of the NEO's orbit, representing the farthest distance between the NEO and the Sun.
8. Perihelion Time: The time of perihelion passage of the NEO's orbit.
9. Mean Anomaly: The mean anomaly of the NEO's orbit, representing the fraction of the orbital period that has elapsed since the last perihelion passage.
10. Mean Motion: The mean motion of the NEO's orbit, representing the average angular velocity of the NEO along its orbit.
11. Hazardous: A binary indicator that specifies whether the NEO is classified as hazardous or not based on its orbit and size. A value of "1"/True indicates that the NEO is classified as hazardous, while a value of "0"/False indicates that it is not considered hazardous.
